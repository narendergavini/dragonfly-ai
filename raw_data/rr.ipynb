      "PS: \"That's revealing - so there's a belief that [paraphrase like 'nighttime is your only personal time,' 'going to bed means surrendering to responsibilities,' 'you deserve this time for yourself,' 'the day hasn't given you what you need']. Now I want you to honestly assess the quality of those late-night hours.

      "[Caller reflects on late-night quality - 45 seconds] \n",
      "PS: \"Stay with that honesty. You described [reference their assessment like 'mindless scrolling you don't enjoy,' 'half-watching things while feeling guilty,' 'not actually relaxing just avoiding sleep'].

      "[Caller confirms - 10 seconds] \n",

Yet you're sacrificing that high-quality next day for low-quality current night hours that aren't even satisfying. That's a catastrophic trade-off.\" \n",
      "[Caller reflects - 15 seconds] \n",
      "PS: \"Now I want to do a visualization exercise with two different timelines. First timeline: you continue your current bedtime procrastination pattern for the next six months. Every night you intend to sleep at a reasonable hour but delay for hours. You're chronically sleep-deprived. It's six months from now. What has chronic sleep deprivation done to your health, your weight, your stress levels? What's your daily energy and mood quality? What opportunities are you missing because you're too exhausted? What's your risk for serious health consequences? How sustainable does this feel?\" \n",
      "[Caller envisions specific negative consequences - 50 seconds] \n",
      "PS: \"Sit with that reality. That's the cost of chronic voluntary sleep deprivation. Now, completely different timeline: it's six months from now, and you've established consistent, adequate sleep. You go to bed at a planned time, get 7-8 hours regularly, wake feeling restored. What's different? How is your energy throughout the day? What's your mood stability? How has your productivity changed? What's your health trajectory? How does it feel to not be constantly exhausted? What are you able to do with abundant energy that exhaustion prevented?\" \n",
      "[Caller identifies specific positive outcomes - 50 seconds] \n",
      "PS: \"The difference between those timelines is sleep prioritization - treating sleep as non-negotiable restoration rather than optional surrender. Given everything you've shared - the real cost to health and functioning, the evidence that adequate sleep transforms your quality of life, and the sustainability you need - how important is it to you to stop delaying bedtime? Scale of 1-10.\" \n",
      "[Caller rates importance - 10 seconds] \n",
      "PS: \"That's a [number] on importance. Now, confidence: how confident are you that you can actually go to bed at a planned time rather than delaying for hours? Same 1-10 scale.\" \n",
      "[Caller rates confidence - 10 seconds] \n",
      "PS: \"I appreciate that honesty. [If low confidence: 'Even at a [number], that means you see some possibility.'] What makes you doubt you can honor a bedtime? Is it feeling like you haven't had enough personal time during the day, the pull of activities, difficulty ending the day, or something else?\" \n",
      "[Caller identifies specific concerns - 30 seconds] \n",
      "PS: \"Those concerns are valid, and we're going to address them with specific bedtime architecture that honors your need for personal time while protecting sleep. Here's what I know: you've experienced the dramatic difference between adequate sleep and sleep deprivation - you described [reference their example] - which means you understand the impact intellectually. Now we're building systems that make consistent bedtime behavioral. I want to introduce you to a specific, proven approach. Ready?\" \n",
      "[Caller agrees - 5 seconds] \n",
      "Phase IV: Implement the Erythemis Strategy (8 minutes) \n",
      "PS: \"The approach I'm going to teach you is based on Erythemis dragonflies - the pondhawk species known for their circadian rhythm regulation and strategic rest timing. Unlike species that fly until complete exhaustion, Erythemis align their activity with optimal times and rest proactively when conditions become suboptimal. They've mastered the balance between activity and rest - they don't resist necessary rest; they embrace it as performance optimization. This is exactly how we're going to transform your bedtime pattern. This is the Erythemis Strategy - restorative sleep through strategic rest timing. Make sense so far?\" \n",
      "[Caller confirms - 5 seconds] \n",
      "PS: \"Perfect. Here's how we apply it. Right now, bedtime feels like surrender or loss of personal time, so you resist it. We're going to use a technique called Personal Time Architecture - ensuring adequate personal time during waking hours so sleep doesn't feel like deprivation. \n",
      "First, Daytime Autonomy Audit. Bedtime procrastination often happens because your entire day feels controlled by obligations - work, responsibilities, others' demands - and nighttime is the only time that feels like yours. We need to assess whether you actually have personal autonomy time during the day. \n",
      "Walk me through yesterday or a typical day. When did you have time that felt genuinely yours - not work, not obligations, not serving others' needs, just time for what you wanted?\" \n",
      "[Caller describes personal time availability - 45 seconds] \n",
      "PS: \"That's revealing. You described [reference their reality like 'essentially no personal time until late night,' 'brief moments that didn't feel sufficient,' 'time that existed but you didn't use for yourself']. This is the root cause - you're staying up late trying to claim the personal time your day didn't provide. We need to solve this during daylight hours, not by sacrificing sleep. \n",
      "Protected Personal Time Scheduling: You need non-negotiable personal time built into your day - before bedtime - where you do something genuinely for yourself, guilt-free. \n",
      "What would genuinely restore you or feel like valuable personal time? This might be reading, hobby time, exercise, creative work, socializing, solitude - whatever actually matters to you.\" \n",
      "[Caller identifies meaningful personal activities - 35 seconds] \n",
      "PS: \"Good. Now, when could you realistically schedule 30-60 minutes of that personal time during your day or early evening - before the late-night hours? Be specific about when this protected time would happen.\" \n",
      "[Caller identifies personal time window - 30 seconds] \n",
      "PS: \"Perfect. That becomes sacred personal time - it's not optional, it's not sacrificed for work or others' needs, it's non-negotiable restoration and autonomy. This satisfies the need that late-night hours are currently trying to meet. \n",
      "Now, let's address Bedtime Non-Negotiability. Right now, bedtime is a suggestion you constantly violate. We're making it a commitment with the same weight as an important meeting. \n",
      "What time do you need to be asleep - not in bed scrolling, actually asleep - to get adequate sleep before your wake time?\" \n",
      "[Caller calculates needed sleep time - 20 seconds] \n",
      "PS: \"Good. Now, given that sleep takes time to initiate, you need to be in bed, lights off, devices away, at least 15-30 minutes before that. What's your Lights-Off Deadline?\" \n",
      "[Caller sets lights-off time - 15 seconds] \n",
      "PS: \"Perfect. That lights-off time is now absolute - it's not flexible, it's not negotiable based on how engaged you are in an activity. It's a commitment to your health and functioning. \n",
      "Now, Reverse-Engineered Wind-Down, because you can't go from full activity to sleep instantly. You need a structured transition that moves you from active state to sleep-ready state. \n",
      "Working backward from your lights-off time, we're going to design a 60-90 minute Wind-Down Protocol with specific stages: \n",
      "Stage 1: Activity Termination (60-90 min before lights-off) - All work, email, productive tasks end. No new commitments started. \n",
      "Stage 2: Screen Reduction (45-60 min before lights-off) - Stimulating screens (social media, news, work) end. Only low-stimulation content if any screen use. \n",
      "Stage 3: Environmental Transition (30-45 min before lights-off) - Lights dimmed, temperature lowered, sleep environment prepared. \n",
      "Stage 4: Calming Activity (15-30 min before lights-off) - Specific calming ritual: reading, gentle stretching, meditation, journaling - something that signals sleep approaching. \n",
      "For your specific situation, what would each stage look like? Starting with Stage 1 - when do all work and productive tasks end?\" \n",
      "[Caller designs Stage 1 - 25 seconds] \n",
      "PS: \"Stage 2 - when do stimulating screens end, and what low-stimulation activity replaces them if any?\" \n",
      "[Caller designs Stage 2 - 25 seconds] \n",
      "PS: \"Stage 3 - when and how do you transition your environment to sleep-ready?\" \n",
      "[Caller designs Stage 3 - 25 seconds] \n",
      "PS: \"Stage 4 - what specific calming activity happens in the final 15-30 minutes before lights-off?\" \n",
      "[Caller designs Stage 4 - 25 seconds] \n",
      "PS: \"Excellent. That protocol moves you systematically from active day to sleep-ready state. Now, let's address Device Removal Architecture, because bedtime procrastination is almost always device-enabled - phones, tablets, laptops make it easy to continue activities indefinitely. \n",
      "At what point in your wind-down protocol do all devices leave your bedroom or become inaccessible? And where do they go - specific physical location?\" \n",
      "[Caller defines device removal timing and location - 30 seconds] \n",
      "PS: \"Perfect. Devices don't sleep with you - they physically leave the sleep environment. Now, Completion Ritual, because bedtime procrastination often involves difficulty 'ending' the day when things feel incomplete. \n",
      "You need a specific ritual that marks the day as complete - gives you psychological closure so you can sleep without feeling things are unfinished. This might be: \n",
      "Writing tomorrow's top 3 priorities to externalize mental planning \n",
      "Journaling 3 things from today to acknowledge completion \n",
      "Speaking a specific phrase: 'Today is complete. Tomorrow is ready.' \n",
      "Physical action: closing a specific door, turning off a specific light \n",
      "What completion ritual would give you psychological closure on the day?\" \n",
      "[Caller creates completion ritual - 30 seconds] \n",
      "PS: \"Good. That ritual signals: the day is done, sleep is appropriate, nothing is being abandoned. Now, let's address Morning Reward Architecture, because one reason staying up late feels valuable is that morning feels like punishment - you're exhausted, you dread waking, there's no positive pull toward sleep-wake cycles. \n",
      "We're going to make morning genuinely appealing by building in something you look forward to - morning becomes a reward for sleeping well rather than a punishment for being alive. \n",
      "What could you build into your morning routine that would genuinely be enjoyable - something you'd actually look forward to? This might be special coffee/tea, a few minutes of something you love, a morning walk, whatever would make waking feel positive.\" \n",
      "[Caller identifies morning reward - 30 seconds] \n",
      "PS: \"Perfect. That morning reward only happens if you honor your bedtime - it's earned through adequate sleep, not available after staying up late. This creates positive pull toward sleep rather than only negative consequences for delaying. \n",
      "Now, Late-Night Activity Substitution, because here's what will happen: at your designated wind-down time, you'll feel pulled to continue whatever you're doing or start something new. You need a specific protocol for that impulse. \n",
      "When you feel resistance to starting wind-down, you'll ask yourself: \n",
      "Question 1: 'Is this activity genuinely valuable and restorative, or am I just avoiding ending the day?' \n",
      "Question 2: 'Will continuing this activity for another hour actually give me what I'm seeking, or will it just make tomorrow harder?' \n",
      "Question 3: 'Can this activity happen tomorrow during my protected personal time instead?' \n",
      "Let's practice. Imagine it's your wind-down start time but you're engaged in scrolling social media and don't want to stop. Walk through the three questions.\" \n",
      "[Caller practices protocol - 35 seconds] \n",
